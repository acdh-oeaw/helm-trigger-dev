# Trigger.dev Architecture

This document provides detailed information about the Trigger.dev architecture and components.

## System Architecture

The Trigger.dev platform consists of several key components that work together to provide a robust event-driven workflow system:

### Core Components

1. **Web Application**
   - Frontend interface for users
   - API endpoints for client interactions
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Project management interface

2. **Worker**
   - Processes background jobs
   - Handles task execution
   - Manages job queues
   - Implements retry logic

3. **Supervisor**
   - Coordinates task execution
   - Manages job scheduling
   - Handles task dependencies
   - Monitors job status

4. **Database**
   - Stores user data
   - Manages job metadata
   - Handles authentication
   - Tracks execution history

5. **Redis**
   - Job queue management
   - Caching layer
   - Real-time updates
   - Session storage

## Component Interactions

The components interact in the following ways:

1. **User Interface Flow**
   - Users interact with the web application
   - Web app authenticates requests
   - API endpoints process user actions
   - Results are returned to the user

2. **Job Processing Flow**
   - Jobs are created via API
   - Supervisor schedules execution
   - Worker processes jobs
   - Results are stored in database

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Redis handles pub/sub
   - Web app receives updates
   - UI reflects current state
   - Users see live progress

## Deployment Architecture

When deployed via Helm, the components are organized as follows:

```
Kubernetes Cluster
├── Namespace: trigger-dev
│   ├── Deployments
│   │   ├── trigger-dev-app (Web Application)
│   │   ├── trigger-dev-worker (Job Processing)
│   │   └── trigger-dev-supervisor (Task Coordination)
│   ├── Jobs
│   │   └── trigger-dev-migrations (Database Setup)
│   ├── Services
│   │   ├── trigger-dev-app
│   │   ├── trigger-dev-worker
│   │   └── trigger-dev-supervisor
│   └── Ingress
│       └── trigger-dev-ingress
```

## Data Flow

1. **Job Creation**
   ```
   User → Web App → API → Database
   ```

2. **Job Execution**
   ```
   Supervisor → Worker → External Services → Database
   ```

3. **Status Updates**
   ```
   Worker → Redis → Web App → User
   ```

## Scaling Considerations

The architecture supports horizontal scaling:

- Multiple worker replicas for parallel job processing
- Load-balanced web application
- Distributed Redis cluster
- Scalable database

## Security Architecture

The system implements multiple security layers:

1. **Authentication**
   - Email-based authentication
   - OAuth integration
   - Session management

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Project-level permissions
   - API key management

3. **Network Security**
   - TLS encryption
   - Network policies
   - Pod security contexts

## Monitoring and Observability

The system provides various monitoring points:

1. **Application Metrics**
   - Request rates
   - Error rates
   - Response times

2. **Job Metrics**
   - Queue lengths
   - Processing times
   - Success/failure rates

3. **System Metrics**
   - Resource utilization
   - Component health
   - Database performance
